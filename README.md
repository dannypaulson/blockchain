finding a solution for a rubix cube-like game
My mom had this old game from her childhood out in our kitchen. It consists of four separate blocks, having a combination of white, red, green, and blue colored sides. The object of the game is to stack the blocks such that on each of the four sides of the stack, there is one white side, one red side, one green side, and one blue side. I spent a while trying to solve it and I couldn't, so I decided it would be fun to try and write a program to do it for me. It was also a good opportunity to learn git/github.
