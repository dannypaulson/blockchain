My mom had this game from her childhood in our kitchen for a while. It consists of four separate
cubes, each of which contains sides that are white, red, green, or blue in colour. The object of
the game is to stack the four blocks such that each of the four sides of the stack has one
white, one red, one green, and one blue face. I tried for a while to solve it but couldn't, so I
thought it would be fun to try and make a program to model the game and generate a solution. It 
was also a good opportunity for me to learn to use git/github.
