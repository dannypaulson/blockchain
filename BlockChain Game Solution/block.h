/*
 The order of rotation of a block is defined as follows:
        0-3: The block is rotated 4 times about its top-bottom axis
        4-7: The block is rotated once about its left-right axis, then rotated 4 times about its top-bottom axis
        8-11: The block is rotated once more about its left-right axis, then rotated 4 times about its top-bottom axis
        12-15: The block is rotated once more about its left-right axis, then rotated 4 times about its top-bottom axis
        16-19: The block is rotated once more about its left-right axis to return to its root orientation, then once
                about its front-back axis and four times about its top-bottom axis
        20-24: The block is rotated twice more about its front-back axis, and then four times about its top-bottom axis
 
 This can be thought of as putting the top face in each of the six possible positions, and for each of these positions checking all the possible orientations.
